This is adabru's (=me) personal introduction. I was born in Germany and was taught about computer and programming by my older brother. Later I enjoyed (more or less) formal education in Computer Science. I still live in Germany. The goal I am compelled to is to promote people's abilities of self-determination. I do not see much sense in it but I feel very curious about what outcome it would have if all people are living mostly self-determined?
